# Quick Reference to HP 2000 Time-Shared BASIC

Reference for all commands used in STTR1.

## SIMPLE VARIABLE

A letter from A to Z; or a letter immediately followed by a number (from 0 to 9).  
Examples: A0, B, M5, C2, Z9, D

Variables are used to represent numeric values.

There are two other types of variables, string variables and array variables.

## FORMATTED OUTPUT

The following format specifiers are used in STTR1:

|Format specifier|Meaning|
|:---|:---|
|__D__|one digit|
|__3D__|3 digits, left padded with spaces|
|__4D__|4 digits, left padded with spaces|
|__5D__|5 digits, left padded with spaces|
|__6D__|6 digits, left padded with spaces|
|__8X__|8 spaces|
|__9X__|9 spaces|
|__11X__|11 spaces|
|__15X__|15 spaces|
|__3A__|3 characters of a string; left padded with whitespace?|
|__6A__|6 characters of a string; left padded with whitespace?|
|__3(3D," :")__|3 times: 3 digits followed by " :"|
|__8(X,3A)__|8 times: 1 space followed by 3 characters of a string|
|__8(3X,3D)__|8 times: 3 characters of a string followed by 3 digits|


## FUNCTIONS
_Functions return a numeric result; they may be used as expressions or parts of expressions. PRINT is used for examples only; other statement types may be used._

|Full Name|Example&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Purpose|
|:---|:---|:---|
|__`DEF FN`__ |<code>__DEF FNA__(X)=(M*X)+B</code>|Allows the programmer to define functions; the function label (A) must be a letter from A to Z; the argument(X) is a dummy variable.|
|__`ABS(X)`__|<code>310 PRINT __ABS(X)__</code>|Gives the absolute value of the expression (X).|
|__`INT(X)`__|<code>330 PRINT __INT(X)__</code>|Gives the largest integer &le; the expression (X).|
|__`RND(X)`__|<code>350 PRINT __RND(X)__</code>|Generates a random number greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1; the argument (X) may have any value. A negative argument is used to restart a sequence of random numbers.|
|__`SQR(X)`__|<code>360 PRINT __SQR(X)__</code>|Gives the square root of the expression (X); expression must have a positive value.|
|__`TIM(X)`__|<code>460 PRINT __TIM(X)__</code>|Gives current minute (X=0) 0-59 or hour (X=1) 0-23.|

## MATRICES
_NOTES:_
1. _Absolute maximum matrix size is 4900 elements._
2. _Matrix variables must be a single letter from A to Z._

|Name|Sample Statement|Purpose|
|:---|:---|:---|
|__`DIM`__|<code>10 __DIM__ A (10,20)</code>|Allocates space for a matrix of the specified dimensions.|
|__`MAT ZER`__|<code>__MAT__  B=__ZER__</code>|Sets all elements of the specified matrix equal to 0.|

## STRINGS
_NOTES:_
1. _A string is 1 to 72 characters enclosed in quotes; it may be assigned to a string variable (an A to Z letter followed by a $)._
2. _Each string variable used in a program must be dimensional (with a DIM statement) if it has a length of more than one character. The DIM sets the physical or maximum length of a string._
3. _Substrings are described by subscripted string variables. For example, if A$ = "ABCDEF", A$(2,2) = B, A$(1,4) = "ABCD" and A$(3) = "CDEF"._

|Full Name/Symbol|Example (Abbreviation)|Purpose|
|:---|:---|:---|
|__`DIM`__ |<code>10 __DIM__ A$ (27)</code>|Declares maximum string length in characters.|
|__`=`__ |<code>20 A$="**TEXT1</code>|Assigns the character string in quotes to a string variable.|
|__`=`__ |<code>105&nbsp;IF&nbsp;A$=C$&nbsp;THEN&nbsp;600</code>|Allows comparison of strings, and substrings and transfer to a specified statement if the comparison is true. Comparison is made in ASCII codes, character by character, left to right until a difference is found.|
|__`INPUT`__ |<code>205 __INPUT__ N$</code>|Accepts as many characters as the string can hold (followed by a _return_). The characters need not be in quotation marks.|

## OPERATORS

_NOTE: The numeric values used in logical evaluation are:_
* _"true" = any nonzero number_
* _"false" = 0_

|Symbol|Sample Statement|Purpose/Meaning/Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|__`=`__ |<code>100 A = B = C = 0</code>|Assignment operator; assigns a value to a variable.|
|__`^`__|<code>120 PRINT X^2</code>|Exponentiate (as in XÂ²).|

The PRINT statement provides a simple and direct means for BASIC programs to display values on your terminal.  
The items to be printed (print list) are evaluated and displayed in sequential order from left to right in one or more lines. Each item in the print list is separated from the following one by either a semicolon or a comma.  
A semicolon serves only to separate items in the print list; the first character of the following item's value is printed immediately after the last character of the preceding item's value.  
A new line is begun whenever the next value will not fit on the remainder of the current line.

A comma serves another purpose besides separating print list items.  
Each line on the terminal is divided into four consecutive fields of 15 character positions and a final field of 12 character positions (72 character positions per line).  
When a comma follows an item which did not completely fill the last of the one or more fields its value occupies, blanks are added to complete that field.  
Thus the value of an item following a comma always begins at the start of a field.  
If the previously completed field was the last one in the current line, the next item's value will be printed on a new line.  
Since most values occupy less than fifteen character positions, the usual effect is a table of five columns per line.

If a comma or semicolon follows the last item in the print list, the print list of the next PRINT statement executed will be printed as a continuation of the current line.  
Otherwise, the current line is completed and the next PRINT statement will begin printing values on the next line.  
A PRINT statement with no item list either completes the previous line, if it ended with a comma or semicolon, or skips the current line.  
This is frequently used to produce a blank line.
